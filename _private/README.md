# Notice:
This folder has been named _private, so that you may see the used structure
of my own privat folder. My own private configurations will not be published.

# How to use:
Edit the files in here to be configurable to your own environments. You 
may simply ignore hosting this and use a local server if you like.

Rename this folder to "private" so that the code can reach your configurations.
